# Gear Tracker

A portfolio project to track backpacking gear weight built with react on the front end and rails on the back end. Inspired by https://lighterpack.com/. The site can be found on https://fathomless-headland-84060.herokuapp.com/ and is deployed on a  Heroku free dyno so give time for the server to start. 

Currently building another version that uses Redux
