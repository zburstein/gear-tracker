# Gear Tracker

A portfolio project to track backpacking gear weight built with react on the front end and rails on the back end. Inspired by https://lighterpack.com/. The site can be found on https://fathomless-headland-84060.herokuapp.com/ and is **deployed on a  Heroku free dyno so give time for the server to start**. Version 1 was set up with vanilla react, but new version uses react-redux. Still in development but current build is stable. Current design is for 13 inch screen and up but compatibility will be added later. 

There are currently some client side computations that are redundant with the back end that was initially set up in the interest of making a PWA, but that may be removed for the sake of simplicity.
